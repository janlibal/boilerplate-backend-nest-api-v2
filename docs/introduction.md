# Introduction

Nestjs Boilerplate API is a simple RESTful API boilerplate project written in TS, and built using Nestjs, Prisma, Redis, Swagger, Postgres, Pino and jest for testing. Please note that this API is built for demonstration purposes only and in a go-live solution is going to be more advanced. In case you wish to develop the project from scratch yourself, please follow commits from start to finish.
